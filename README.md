# RSA-cryptographic-algorithm
RSA is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys.
This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone.
Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and Private key is kept private.
 
RSA encryption is often used in combination with other encryption schemes, or for digital signatures which can prove the authenticity and integrity of a message. It isnâ€™t generally used to encrypt entire messages or files, because it is less efficient and more resource-heavy than symmetric-key encryption.
